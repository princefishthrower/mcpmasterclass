## Lesson Organization

This is the `main` branch, and contains no source code from the lessons. The source code for each lesson is in a separate branch, named `lesson-<number>`. For example, the source code for lesson 1 is in the `lesson-1` branch. To follow along with the lessons, you can switch to the appropriate branch using the following command:

```shell
git checkout lesson-1
```
